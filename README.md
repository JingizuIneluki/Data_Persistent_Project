# Data_Persistent_Project
Unity_Learning_Data between sesions
For this version of the Data Persistent Project I've created a GameManager.cs that controls all data between scnes and persistent
You can write your name and save it for the TopScorers scene which is shown when the game is over
Also you have control of the music and the color of the player
You can quit the game anytime and the data will be saved
